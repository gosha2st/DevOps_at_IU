# Best practices (Python & Docker)

## Best practices for a Python web application

### General code writing and styling
1. Follow guidelines from *PEP 8 - The Official Style Guide for Python Code*:  
http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
2. Follow other popular and commonly-accepted **guidelines** on code writing in Python, such as:
    * *PEP 20 - The Zen of Python*:  
http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/
    * *BOBP Guide for Python*:  
http://gist.github.com/sloria/7001839
    * *Google Python Style Guide*:  
http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html
    * *The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python*:  
http://docs.python-guide.org/
    * *PEP 257 - Docstring Conventions* (for proper Documentation):  
http://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
    * *Sphinx Style Guide*:  
http://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html
    * *Numpy Style Guide*:

        * http://medium.com/worldsensing-techblog/tips-and-tricks-for-unit-tests-b35af5ba79b1
        * and others.
3. Always **refer to common sense** and apply all previously and subsequently listed guidelines only as long as sensible.
4. Maintain proper, clear, and yet simple **documentation**.
5. Make use of *linters* and other **static analysis tools** wherever possible, such as:
    * *PyLint*: http://pylint.org/
    * *Darglint*: http://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint
    * *Pyflakes*: http://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes
    * *pycodestyle (pep8)*: http://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle
    * *Prospector*: http://prospector.landscape.io/en/master/
    * *bandit*: http://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
    * *mypy*: http://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/
    * *safety*: http://github.com/pyupio/safety
    * *SonarQube*: http://sonarqube.org/
    * and others.
6. Use well-tested and production ready **frameworks**, such as:
    * *Django*: http://djangoproject.com/
    * *Flask*: http://flask.palletsprojects.com/
    * *FastAPI*: http://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
    * *Sanic*: http://sanicframework.org/en/
    * etc.
7. Apply **formatting tools**, such as:
    * *black*: http://github.com/psf/black
    * *isort*: http://github.com/PyCQA/isort
    * *pyupgrade*: http://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade
    * *editorconfig*: http://editorconfig.org/
    * etc.
8. Consider ready-to-use *pre-commit* **hooks** with code-formatting -- a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks: http://pre-commit.com/
9. Introduce two running scripts -- for development and production modes.
10. Use production-ready WSGI server (*Gunicorm*) instead of Flask development server in production.

### Project management
1. Create and maintain the `README` file.
2. Create and maintain the `requirements.txt` file for Python packages.
3. Utilize *git* for better version control.
4. Add `.gitignore` to exclude irrelevant files from the Git VCS.  
gitignore.io can be used to generate *gitignore* files for popular tools.
5. Include `.dockerignore` to reduce docker context size.
6. Same for `.editorconfig`.
7. Check `lockfile` into version control to ensure reproducible builds locally and in CI.
8. Introduce dependency management utility, such as:
    * *Pipenv*: http://docs.pipenv.org/
    * *Poetry*: http://python-poetry.org/
    * etc.
9. Place files into appropriate folders and functions into appropriate modules.
10. Partition distinct projects into separate virtual environments to prevent version conflicts.

### Tests and unit testing
1. Strive for 100% code coverage, but don't get obsess over the coverage score.
2. Test each little piece of software independently.
3. Tests should be isolated and fully independent:
    * They should pass regardless the order of execution.
    * They should run on a fresh dataset every time.
    * Do not interact with a real database or network.
    * Use a separate test database that gets torn down or use mock objects.
4. Do not modify the application code in tests.
5. Use one testcase class for a single class or model.
6. Never manually create `Response` objects for tests.
7. Parametrize your tests.  
Do not use the same test copy-pasted many times with different inputs.
8. Follow the *Given-When-Then* style of writing tests: http://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html
9. Use ready-made testing frameworks, for example *PyTest*: http://docs.pytest.org/en/
10. Consider using *Test Driven Development (TDD)*.
11. Introduce *Functional Tests* for web and GUI applications to simulate end-user behaviour.
12. Separate between *Unit* and *Functional Tests*.
13. Use *fixtures* to provide common setup and teardown code.
14. Use *yield fixtures*.
15. Do not modify fixtures in other fixtures.
16. But better prefer *factories* over *fixtures*:
http://github.com/FactoryBoy/factory_boy
17. Prefer `tmpdir` over global test artifacts.
18. Add running tests into *pre-commit* hooks, so that developers do not push broken code.  
(Only in case the number of test is not huge!)
19. Write tests as scenarios. Testcase and test method names should read like a scenario description.
20. Treat test code as core code. Make your test code readable, use docstrings and comments and respect style, almost as if it was a part of the functional code base.
21. Refer to online guidelines, such as:
    * General:
        * *Python Code Quality: Tools & Best Practices*:  
http://realpython.com/python-code-quality/
    * PyTest:
        * *Effective Python Testing With Pytest*:

## Best practices for Docker:

### General
1. Avoid defining users as numbers, because this may cause collisions in some environments.  
Prefer **letter naming** instead.
2. Be specific with **versions** used in dependencies.
3. Support configuration of the container via **environment variables**.
4. Use consistent, clear, yet simple, and **appropriate naming** for different stages.
5. Add `docker-compose` file to the root of repository, showing the example of usage.
6. Explicitly mark used ports with `EXPOSE` instruction, so that other images (like automated *NGINX* proxy) may take advantage of this.
7. Include **metadata** labels when building an image -- this helps subsequent managing:
    * application version;
    * link to a website;
    * ways to contact the author and maintainer;
    * etc.

### Lightweight and simplicity
1. Keep images **small** and **standalone**.
2. Avoid unnecessary **dependencies**.
3. Use **multi-stage builds**, when applicable. They allow to:
    * significantly reduce the final size of an image;
    * make use of caching for layers and stages;
    * avoid compiling dependencies.
4. Clear space by removing package manager **cache**.
5. Include `.dockerignore` to reduce docker context size.
6. Organize **layers** concisely to leverage build cache:
    * First install dependencies, and then copy the source code.
    * Push up parts of the Dockerfile that are rarely changed to enable layers caching.
7. **Minimize** number of layers by grouping `RUN`, `COPY` and `ADD` instructions.  
Other instructions do not increase the size of a build.
8. Use `COPY` instructions instead of `ADD` wherever possible.
9. Apply a `COPY` operation only to the source folder, leaving unnecessary files away.
10. **Decouple** different applications from each other, so that each container has only one concern, making it easier to scale horizontally and reuse containers.
11. Make use of *linting* tools to detect bad practices and improve overall style.  
For example *hadolint*, written in purely functional Haskell:  
http://github.com/hadolint/hadolint
12. Consider creating your images based on **Alpine Linux**, which provides considerably slim container.

### Security
1. Use **rootless** user account.  
Run a server as a **restricted user**, lowering the privileges of potentially malicious code.  
For this, apply the `USER` instruction to change the default **UID** from 0 to a custom one.  
Avoid defining users as numbers -- prefer letter naming instead.
2. Make executable binaries **owned by root** and **not writable** (i.e. **read-only**).  
This blocks the executing user from modifying existing binaries and scripts, which prevents various attacks.
3. Avoid unnecessary **privileges**.
4. In a multistage build, create an **intermediate container**, from which then copy only the resulting artifacts to the final image.  
This will reduce the number of files and shrink possible attack surface.
5. Perform **regular scans** on images to detect potential vulnerabilities and security issues:
    * *snyk*: http://snyk.io/
    * *aqua trivy*: http://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy
    * *grype*: http://github.com/anchore/grype
    * and others.
